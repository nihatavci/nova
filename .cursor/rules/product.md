**Core Principles:**

*   **Clarity:** Information should be easily scannable and understandable.
*   **Trust:** The design should instill confidence in the service.
*   **Simplicity:**  Reduce visual clutter to focus on the core functionality.

**Refined UI Suggestions:**

**1. Overall:**

*   **Background:** The pure white background is too harsh. Use `#F9F9FA` or `#F5F5F5` for a softer, more inviting look.
*   **Shadows:**  Use subtle box shadows to give elements depth. Avoid harsh shadows.
*   **Borders:** Use very light gray borders (`#E5E7EB`) for separation instead of thick dark lines.

**2. Header:**

*   **Navigation:**
    *   **Active State:** The "Home" button's active state needs more contrast. Try a slight background color change and bolding the text.
    *   **Alignment:** Ensure the navigation items are evenly spaced.
    *   **Logo/Branding:** Replace the current logo if necessary, a clean icon works well.

**3. Hero Section:**

*   **Headline:**
    *   "Free RRS Score for Expats in Germany" is good, but could be more targeted: "Retire Confidently in Germany: Get Your Free RRS Score."
    *   Use a larger font size and ensure it is easily readable on all devices.
    *   Re-position the headline, make it left align and smaller than current, looks too bold
*   **Sub-Headline:**
    *   Keep the concise and benefit-driven text.
    *   Improve the call of action "Discover how to save â‚¬10k+ annually with our tailored financial solutions. No jargon, no commission - just clear financial advice.".
*   **Badges (GDPR, Satisfied Customers, Process Time):**
    *   **Placement:** Move these below the sub-headline for a less cluttered look.
    *   **Styling:**
        *   Simplify the icons to outlined versions.
        *   Reduce their size.
        *   Keep the text short and to the point (e.g., "Data Secure", "Trusted by Expats", "Quick Process").
    *  Make the badge a bit transparent
*   **"View Your Financial Dashboard" Button:**
    *   Color: Use a more noticeable color for the button, such as a shade of blue (`#3B82F6`).
    *   The arrow icon should be prominent and match the color of the button.

**4. "Retirement Provision" Section:**

*   **Card Background:** Change the dark background to a lighter shade, such as `#FFFFFF`, to improve readability.
*   **Title:**
    *   "Best Retirement Provision in 2025\*" is unclear. Change to "Estimate Your Retirement Readiness" or "Check Your Retirement Plan".
    *  Re-position the title to the center with smaller font size.
*   **Progress Indicator:**
    *   "Step 11 of 11" is too prominent. Use a subtle progress bar at the top or bottom of the card instead.
*   **"What is your retirement goal?" Options:**
    *   **Consistency:** All cards should be the same size.
    *   **Selection:** The selected card needs a clearer visual indicator.  Use a light blue border (`#3B82F6`) and a checkmark icon.
    *   **Descriptions:** Provide a brief, clear description *below* each retirement goal option.
*   **"Start Over" Button:**
    *   This is unclear, should be replaced with "Clear", "Reset".
*   **"Back" and "Skip" Buttons:**
    *   "Back": Keep as a standard button.
    *   "Skip": Make this a smaller, less prominent button. For example, a simple text link with a light grey color, positioned to the right.
    *   Ensure both are always visible (fixed at the bottom).
*   **"Premium Analysis":**
    *  Make it secondary button
    * The start over button should be next to it
*   **Bottom Text ("Used by 3,432 satisfied customers -  GDPR Compliant"):**
    *   Remove it.
    *   Trust signals are important, so should add them to the Footer.

**5. Typography & Spacing:**

*   **Font:** Use a clear and readable sans-serif font (e.g., Open Sans, Lato, Roboto).
*   **Font Sizes:** Establish a clear visual hierarchy using different font sizes.
*   **Line Height:** Ensure comfortable line height for readability.
*   **Whitespace:** Use generous whitespace to avoid visual clutter.

**Revised Color Scheme Example:**

*   **Primary:** `#FFFFFF` (Cards, elements)
*   **Secondary:** `#F5F5F5` (Background)
*   **Accent:** `#3B82F6` (Buttons, active states)
*   **Text:** `#374151` (Dark gray)
*   **Border:** `#E5E7EB` (Light gray)

**Example Implementation Snippet (Conceptual - Adapt to Framework):**

```html

  body {
    background-color: #F5F5F5;
    font-family: sans-serif;
    color: #374151;
  }

  .button-primary {
    background-color: #3B82F6;
    color: white;
    border: none;
    padding: 12px 24px;
    border-radius: 6px;
    cursor: pointer;
  }

  .card {
    background-color: #FFFFFF;
    border-radius: 8px;
    padding: 20px;
    box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05); /* Subtle shadow */
  }

  .progress-bar {
    /* Styling for a subtle progress bar */
  }

  /* ... Other styles ... */
